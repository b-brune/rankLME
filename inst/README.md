# Description of the supplemental code

## Code:

* `simulation_setup.Rmd`: provides a basic description of how the model can be simulated
* `simulation_helpers.R`: helper functions loaded by `simulation_setup.Rmd`
* `simulation_and_evaluation_code.R`: provides code to set up the registry for simulation, preprocess the results, and reproduce the figures in the paper
* `sleepstudy_example.R`: provides code to reproduce the sleepstudy example in the paper
* `pv_examples.R`: provides code to reproduce the two applications to photovoltaik data in the paper

## R-Data:

* `results_leverage_with_hat.Rdata` simulation results from `simulation_setup.Rmd`
