# rankLME

The R-package `rankLME` implements a robust rank-based approach to the estimation of mixed effects models with random slopes. The methodology is presented in "A Rank-Based Estimation Method for Mixed Effects Models in the Presence of Outlying Data" by Barbara Brune, Irene Ortner and Peter Filzmoser (2024). The folder `inst` contains code to reproduce the data examples and the structure of the simulation studies presented in the paper.

The core function in the package is the function `ranklme`.
