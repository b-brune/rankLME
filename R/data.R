#' PV Dataset 1
#' 
#' @format ## `pv1`
#' Dataset has the format 48 x 9 and contains data from accelerated aging experiments on photovoltaic modules. 
#' The modules were exposed to two different climatic stresses, denoted by Moderate 2 and Moderate 5. The data set contains the
#' power at maximum power point (pmpp) for 6 modules.

#' PV Dataset 2
#' 
#' @format ## `pv2`
#' Dataset has the format 42 x 12 and contains data from accelerated aging experiments on photovoltaic modules. 
#' The modules were exposed to two different climatic stresses, denoted by Tropical 1 and Tropical 2.  The data set contains the
#' power at maximum power point (pmpp) for 6 modules as well as three peak areas extracted from an FTIR spectrum.
